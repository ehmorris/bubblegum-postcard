--bubblegum-postcard--

inspired by kusama's polka dot work, this is a collaborative canvas for drawing
colored circles.  works on mobile and browser.

The original prototype was written in processing and can be seen here, note that
it does not include the collaboration part: whichlight.com/kusama_circles

this uses socket.io, processingjs, and jquery

play with it here:
